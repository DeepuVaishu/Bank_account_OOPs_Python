# Banking System in Python

## Project Overview
This project is a simulation of a basic banking system using Python. It was created to showcase fundamental object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, methods, and user interaction through simple input and output. The program allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit and withdraw money, and view their balance.

The project is structured to demonstrate how Python can handle account management, user authentication, and transaction processing, which are essential elements in any banking application.

## Features
### Core Features:
1. **Account Creation**: Users can set up a new account by entering a username and a password. Optionally, users can make an initial deposit during account creation.
2. **User Authentication**: Existing users can securely log in by providing the correct username and password.
3. **Deposits**: Users who are logged in can deposit funds into their account, with the system updating their balance accordingly.
4. **Withdrawals**: Users can withdraw funds as long as they have sufficient balance in their account.
5. **Balance Tracking**: Each deposit or withdrawal updates the userâ€™s balance, which is stored and displayed after each transaction.

### Extra Features:
- **Multiple User Accounts**: The system supports multiple users, each with a unique username and password, ensuring secure access to individual accounts.
- **Input Validation**: The program checks for invalid input, such as negative values for deposits or withdrawals, and insufficient funds for withdrawals.

### Additional Information:
The program is designed to handle typical banking operations and can easily be expanded with new features, such as:
- Account balance checks
- Transaction histories
- Advanced user authentication mechanisms

## Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files:
- **`BankAccount.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook file includes the full implementation of the banking system. It allows users to interact with the system step-by-step in an interactive environment.
- **`Bank_Account.py`**: This Python script is the exported version of the Jupyter Notebook. It is a standalone script that can be run in any Python environment.
- **`banking.docx`**: This Word document contains screenshots that demonstrate the program in action. 

## Project Motivation
The aim of this project is to test coding and logical skills by implementing a simple banking system in Python. It also demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming for real-world scenarios like managing user accounts and transactions in a secure and organized way. 

This project is part of an academic exercise to test confidence in Python syntax and logic and includes additional extra features for bonus points.
